# Seoul-Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction
Currently Rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort.

It is important to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens the waiting time.

The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes.

The aim of this project is to address this challenge by combining historical bike usage patterns with weather data to forecast bike rental demand.

I have conducted an initial exploratory data analysis and visualisation using matplotlib and seaborn.

Have used python libraries such as pandas,numpy and sklearn to develop the prediction algorithm.

I have also created a streamlit web application which have been deployed on streamlit community cloud.
